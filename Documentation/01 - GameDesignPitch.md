THE STORY
Jenny reluctantly books a trip to her parents’ place for an obligatory family visit. 
What she was expecting to be a boring and uneventful weekend back home takes a turn when she discovers the suburban locals have come to resent tourists from the big city...

FIGHT TO SURVIVE
Playing as Jenny, you’re forced to defend yourself from hordes of suburban hillbillies. You find a pistol tucked away in the garage of your parents’ place - lucky!
